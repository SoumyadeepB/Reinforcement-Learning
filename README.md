# Reinforcement Learning

A Collection of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms implemented in Python:

- **Multi-Armed Bandit**
  - The multi-armed bandit problem is a classical problem that demonstrates the Exploration vs Exploitation dilemma. 
     - Situation: *k* slot machines in a casino - each configured with unknown reward probabilities.
     - Question: Which of the *k* levers must be pulled to achieve highest long-term rewards?

- **Frozen Lake (Brute Force all State-Action pairs)**
- **Frozen Lake (Policy Iteration)**
- **Monte-Carlo method on the Blackjack game (First-visit and Exploring Starts)**
- **Sarsa**
- **Q-Learning**
